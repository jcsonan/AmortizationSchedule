# AmortizationSchedule

This is an amortization schedule calculator using JavaFX.

Using the Loan Amount, Annual Interest Rate, and Term (in years) entered in by the user, the program will calculate the following:

1. Number of payments made throughout the life of the loan.

2. The monthly payment.

3. The total principal payment (should be the same as the loan amount entered in by the user).

4. The total interest payment.

5. The total payment including both interest and principal.

The program will also show an amortization schedule with a breakdown of your monthly payment as well as the remaining loan balance.
